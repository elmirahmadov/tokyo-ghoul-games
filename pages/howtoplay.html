      <h3>About Tokyo Ghoul</h3>
      <p>
        Tokyo Ghoul is a manga series written and illustrated by Sui Ishida. The
        story follows the survival struggles of humans in Tokyo, where ghouls
        (monstrous creatures) and humans are at war with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The protagonist, Kaneki Ken, becomes part ghoul after a ghoul attack,
        leading him to face new challenges and meet various characters like the
        Quinx Squad, who are both allies and enemies in his fight for survival.
